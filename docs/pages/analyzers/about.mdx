# About analyzers

Analyzers are used to get information about the blob and store it to metadata.
For example, you can get Image `width` and `height` with an image analyzer.

## Usage

Usually you want to run these in delayed jobs to avoid blocking requests. For
example, you can add `afterAttach` callback to Uplo and schedule a blob analyze
job.

```ts
import ImageAnalyzer from '@uplo/analyzer-image';

const uplo = Uplo({
  analyzers: [
    ImageAnalyzer()
  ],
  callbacks: {
    afterAttach: async ({ blob }) => {
      await DelayedJob.performLater('uplo-analyze-blob', { id: blob.id });
    },
  }
})
```

Then, in the delayed job you can find blob and call analyze like this:

```ts
import uplo from '../uplo';

const uploAnalyzeBlob = async ({ id }: { id: ID }) => {
  if (!id) return;

  const blob = await uplo.$findBlob(id);
  if (!blob) return;

  return await blob.analyze();
};
```
