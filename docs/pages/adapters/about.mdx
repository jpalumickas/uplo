# About adapters

Adapters are used to communicate with databases where file blobs and attachments are
stored. `Blob` is used to store all information about the file and in which service
this file is stored. `Attachment` is a connection between record (for example
`User`, `Post`) and a file (`Blob`). One record can optionally have multiple blobs
attached to save cloud storage space.
