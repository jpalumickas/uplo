# About adapters

Adapters used to communicate with databases where file blobs and attachments are
stored. `Blob` is used to store all information about file and in which service
this file is stored. `Attachment` is a connection between record (for example
User, Post) and a file (Blob). One record can have multiple blobs attached to
save cloud storage space.
