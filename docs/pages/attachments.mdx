# Attachments

## Getting started

Add your first attachments to Uplo. For example, we will add `avatar` for `User` and
multiple `images` for `Post`.

```ts
const uplo = Uplo({
  // ... other Uplo config
  attachments: {
    user: {
      avatar: true, // pass true to use default options
    },
    post: {
      images: { multiple: true }
    }
  }
})
```

## Options

* `multiple = false` (*optional*): Specify for multiple attachment support on a single record.
* `serviceName` (*optional*): You can provide a custom service.
* `directUpload = true` (*optional*): You can disable direct uploads for
    specific attachments if needed.


## Find attachment

Find an attachment by specifying `User` ID.

### Single

```ts
const attachment = await uplo.attachments.user(123).avatar.findOne()

console.log(attachment.blob.url());
```

### Multiple

```ts
const attachments = await uplo.attachments.post(456).images.findMany()
```

## Detach attachment

Detach an attachment from a record.

### Single

```ts
const attachment = await uplo.attachments.user(123).avatar.detach()
```

### Multiple

Detach one attachment.

```ts
const attachments = await uplo.attachments.post(456).images.detach(attachmentId)
```

Detach all attachments.

```ts
const attachments = await uplo.attachments.post(456).images.detachMany()
```

## Attach file

Attach a file from a file path.

```ts
const attachment = await uplo.attachments.user(123).avatar.attachFile({
  filePath: '/home/images/image.png',
  contentType: 'image/png',
})
```

Attach a file with content.

```ts
const content = 'This is my file' // Can be string, Buffer

const attachment = await uplo.attachments.user(123).avatar.attachFile({
  content,
  contentType: 'text/plain',
  fileName: 'text.txt',
})
```

## Attach signed file

If you use direct uploads, you get a Signed ID. You need to manually attach a
Signed ID to your records. How to get a Signed ID, please view Client documentation.

```ts
const signedId = req.params['signedId']
const attachment = await uplo.attachments.user(123).avatar.attachSignedFile(signedId)
```
